        <h2> 4,600,000,000 B.C: Earth is formed </h2>
        <p> The Earth is thought to have been formed about 4.6 billion years ago by collisions in the giant disc-shaped cloud of material that also formed the Sun. Gravity slowly gathered this gas and dust together into clumps that became asteroids and small early planets called planetesimals. </p>

        <h2> 270,000,000 B.C: Pangea is formed </h2>
        <p> At this time most of the dry land on Earth was joined into one huge landmass that covered nearly a third of the planet's surface. The giant ocean that surrounded the continent is known as Panthalassa. </p>

        <h2> 200,000,000 B.C: Pangea breaks up </h2>
        <p> The movement of Earth's tectonic plates formed Pangaea and ultimately broke it apart. </p>
