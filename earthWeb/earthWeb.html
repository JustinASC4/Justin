        <h2> 4,600,000,000 B.C: Earth is formed </h2>
        <p> The Earth is thought to have been formed about 4.6 billion years ago by collisions in the giant disc-shaped cloud of material that also formed the Sun. Gravity slowly gathered this gas and dust together into clumps that became asteroids and small early planets called planetesimals. </p>

        <h2> 270,000,000 B.C: Pangea is formed </h2>
        <p> At this time most of the dry land on Earth was joined into one huge landmass that covered nearly a third of the planet's surface. The giant ocean that surrounded the continent is known as Panthalassa. </p>

        <h2> 200,000,000 B.C: Pangea breaks up </h2>
        <p> The movement of Earth's tectonic plates formed Pangaea and ultimately broke it apart. </p>

        <h2> 10,000,000 B.C: Continents are formed </h2>
        <p>The amazing process of plate tectonics, in which the Earth's land masses move slowly across the Earth's crust, is still continuing.</p>

        <h2> 2085: DANGER! </h2>
        <p>As glaciers disappear and areas affected by drought increase, electricity production for the world’s existing hydropower stations will decrease. Hardest hit will be Europe, where hydropower potential is expected to decline on average by 6 percent; around the Mediterranean, the decrease could be up to 50 percent. (IPCC) </p>

        <h2> 2200: Even more danger! </h2>
        <p>An Earth day will be 0.12 milliseconds shorter, as rising temperatures cause oceans to expand away from the equator and toward the poles, one model predicts. One reason water will be shifted toward the poles is most of the expansion will take place in the North Atlantic Ocean, near the North Pole. The poles are closer to the Earth’s axis of rotation, so having more mass there should speed up the planet’s rotation.</p>
